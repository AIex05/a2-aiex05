## The Everyday Quest
This project is designed to help boring people get some fun tasks to do. The client can choose which category of the task, including Life, School, Challenge, and then they will do it. If they do not want to do that, press the "submit" button again, and it will auto generate another task for the client. Clients can also add their costomized tasks into the existing database. The system will tell the client how many tasks have they done, as an achievement.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Evaluation with Alex Bolduc**: Evaluation report is attached below

Alex Bolduc:
Alex took some time to look at it first, and then I started to explain the tasks.

**Get a few new quest in the Life field:**

	He first clicked on the Refresh Database button, at the very bottom of the page. He thought that was the button to retrieve the required information. Then he looked up, and saw the input block, then he started to read over the text above it. He figured it out and then he typed in “Life” in the input block and clicked submit and successfully retrieved a quest.
	
**Mark some tasks as done, meaning that you did it:**

	He quickly hovered the mouse over the “I did it!” button and clicked it without hesitation.
How many tasks have you done so far:
He quickly responded to the correct answer that was shown below the quest.	

**You realized that was a misclick, tell the server that you did not do this task:**

	He quickly clicked the “I did not” button, and successfully updated the data.
	
**Comments:**

At last, he gave several improvements that I can make to make this app more user friendly.
First, he suggested that I use placeholder instead of a value task, because everytime he wants to type something, he has to delete the original value left.
Second, he thought that I can make my website better by making the direction text larger and more noticeable.

**What problems did the user have with your design?**

There is generally no big problem with my design, it is easy to understand and intuitive. But the minor problems include, it is not pretty enough, there are still some functions missing.

**What comments did they make that surprised you?**

Alex Bolduc thought that the “Get database” button is actually the way to retrieve the quests, so I will change that in my future work

**What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?**

I will make my design prettier, and do what Alex Bolduc suggested.
